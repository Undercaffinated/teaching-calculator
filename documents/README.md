# Teaching-Calculator
Designed to not just solve math problems, but to teach students how it solves them.


Goals to achieve:
  - Be able to solve essentially any math problem (correctly)
  - Be quickly accessible on multiple platforms to make it easy for today's students to use.
  - Not just solve math problems, but be able to teach students why it solved problems a certain way.
  - Be able to operate on a step-by-step basis. Students should be able to get help with the next step without having the whole problem solved for them.
  - Be able to produce randomly generated problems that are appropriate for learners.
  - Have topics organized by what grade/level/class students may encounter them.


Future Goals:
  - Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) so that students can take pictures of problems rather than having to input them manually.
  - Implement the ability for the program to recognize a type of problem without guidance and solve it.
  - Implement branching logic paths to allow the program to teach how to solve problems in multiple ways.
  - Implement generated visuals to assist in depicting problems
  - Implement accessibility features like text to speech, dark themes, and visual customization.
  - Utilize feedback and perhaps AI to fine tune how the program goes about teaching.



Development Method:
  - Design and code algorithms capable of solving several types of math problems to be as comprehensive as possible.
  - Prioritize speed on the back-end.
  - Prioritize accessibility and universiality on the front end.

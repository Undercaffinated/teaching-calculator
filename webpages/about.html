            <h2>Why Make Teaching Calculator?</h2>
            <p>The original idea behind Teaching Calculator was to make a tool accessible to students of any demographic studying at any level.
                Originally, I had envisioned creating a phone app that would bring all of the functionality of this site, plus being able to integrate the camera to allow
                users to take photos of the problems they were stuck on and give step-by-step instructions to help get them un-stuck.
